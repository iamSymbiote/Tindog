you probably saw this project million or billion times, but
THIS TIME'S DIFFERENT!
yeah that "tindog" webapp is a common thing in Angela Yu web development project as you can see the on the internet.

BUT I changed this project to a more responsive and give it a bit different design with a;

• faded carousel
• custom images
• gradient background
• brand NEW Pricing div for BS 5.1(hover for a surprise)


DEMO: https://lnkd.in/gqdYCqMc
GITHUB: https://lnkd.in/gqNK8r75


On this project I used as you can see the basics;

-HTML
-CSS
-Bootstap5.1
-Responsive Design
and a bit of; "text-shadow: 2px 4px 4px rgba(5, 10, 25, 8);" if you've had enough :)

You can click the DEMO and check it out my project or you can see my whole project in a place.
Critism appreciated all the time.
Have a good day, cya soon for my future projects lads!
